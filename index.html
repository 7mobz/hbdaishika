			    <p style="font-size:10px;">Happy 17th birthday, Aishika. This is the exact moment you turned 17. It's 12:00 am, 8th of October, 2024. I don't know when you are reading this message, but it was sent exactly at 12:00. Happy birthday again! 🍼, wait don't exit messages will appear. 😅</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">And not only it's your birthday, but also it's a day to look back at all your memories that you had for 17 years of this life. You're 17 years old now, which is about 149040 hours, and it may vary depending on the time of your birth, which I do not know because you didn't show me your birth certificate 😡.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">In minutes if you count, it's 8942400 minutes, and by the time you're reading this message, it's 8942401 and counting. In seconds it will be, 536544000, and it changed, again changed, and yes, again changed, haha.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">Anyways, if you look back in time you might not remember how you were born in the hospital, hehe. You might not remember those nurses who held you in hands, you might not remember the smile on the face of your dad and mom. They are the persons in this whole world who love you the most, did you understand me 😡, doesn't matter if your boyfriend says he loves you the most, he's still on the 3rd rank 😡.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">I'm kidding, but you don't have a boyfriend, or maybe you have idk. But do you remember those things when you were born? 
	Socho socho😁😁🤔🤔</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">I know you're thinking that, "how will I remember I was just a baby!" Well, you can imagine it, it's like virtual reality, but in your head. And yes, you thought it right, "you were just a baby" and still just a baby🍼.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">I don't know whether this message is being read first or last because you have so many friends, it's okay if you are not reading it first. But let me tell you, it was sent exactly at 12:00 with the help of automation. I've started writing this message on 7th October, and I'll write in the evening and it will be sent to you all together, which is already sent and you are reading it 😉
			<p style="font-size:14px;">But, I forgot to tell you one thing, do you remember your first birthday celebration from your memory? I mean can you recall it? If you can then congratulations, you'll never forget it because, normally you would forget it by the age of 20-25, but here's me😎😎 I reminded you about it on your 17th birthday, so there's a small possibility of forgetting that, I hope you remember it your whole life.</p>


<p style="font-size:9px;">Aishika, on this special day, although it's night. Okay then. On this special night, or maybe day! Idk.. anyways, I want you to think of the names of 3 persons whom you love the most. In 10 seconds. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 You thought of them? Okay good now wait, listen to this story.</p>
<p style="font-size:9px;">So, there lived a king long time ago in Germany, his name was Nitzchergchery Géfrztexilnson 🇩🇪, and he was a good poet, he used to write stories, and poems. But wait a minute 🧐, did you just ignore his name, okay! Because you ignored his name, I'll not tell you the whole story 🤪.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">Okay now, what I was about to say was, those three names whom you love the most. I don't care who they are because you again forgot to choose yourself in those 3 people 🥺. Why!!!🥺🥺 Love yourself, embrace yourself, Aish. You are beautiful, kind, generous, and a berry good girl.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">I never write paragraphs...Well, I used to write many years ago but not now. I'm writing it this much long because it's your birthday 😡🍼. I thought i should spread some happiness, because everyone will text and wish why not make a website for my friend</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">Idk how long this message will be, but it will be interesting I guess. I may not exist next year to wish you again in the same way, or maybe a more unexpected and cooler and –98°C cool way. I have an idea. I'll not tell it to you but if I'm alive till next year, you'll see it by yourself or maybe i won't exist ☹️</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">And yes, happy birthday again and again and again 🍼. I'm happy for you. You turned 17, good.
Your heart has beaten 714,816,000 , about 714 million 💓 times in 17 years, and by the time you're reading this message, it has increased by a couple more hundred times📈. In those 17 years, your heart has felt different feelings, sorrow, grief, joy, regret, happiness but still working fine. It healed by itself. It still works. I love it, how it works 24*7 non stop.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">I don't know how to give compliments, I just say good, and you are good girl. I thought to make you extra happy. I have few friends, less than 6, and you are one of them and you are awesome and special.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">Im sorry if I said anything unwanted haha. You know I'm not a mind reader but, I can assure you that you are reading this message in your mind but, in my voice👀.  I built and designed this website today.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;"> Regarding your dream of becoming a dentist. You can achieve it if you have a vision, a clear vision. You need to promise yourself that you must achieve your goal. Convince yourself to make it possible. Manipulate your brain . I know you can achieve it. I believe in you. I hope you do too</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;"> Building this website for you, was just to make you happy. It feels good to spread happiness. But I don't make website for everyone. I made this for you because you are my good friend. Please don't screenshot this or share this link to anyone, because what's made for a person belongs to that person.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">I just wanted you to say that you are a good person. I'll never forget you. Listen to me, do whatever your heart says. But only after reviewing with your brain. May it be anything in life. Anything.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;"> Life is complicated, sometimes it feels beautiful sometimes like shit. But it goes on. Three things i want you to do for life are, 1. Never sleep a night keeping hatred towards anyone in your heart. 2. Unless its extremely bad, forgive everyone. 3. Never miss any opportunity to help anyone, even enemies, strangers and loved ones.  </p>

			<p style="font-size:14px;">Happy Birthday again Aishika,
You can go now ☺️</p>
